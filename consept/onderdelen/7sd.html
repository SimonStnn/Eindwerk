         The 7 segments displays are one of the popular types of display used in various types of embedded applications
         and
         devices. These displays have 8 LEDs inside it to display numbers and alphabets.

      <h2 id="brief-info">7-segment Display Brief Intro</h2>
      <p>
         The seven segments displays are the oldest yet one of the efficient types of display used in embedded
         applications. This
         display has nothing more than 8 LED inside it. These 8 LEDs are separated into each segments which can be named
         as
         a,b,c,d,e,f,g,DP as shown in the picture above. These entire 8 segment LEDs have one end of their pins pulled
         out of the
         module as shown above and the other ends are connected together and pulled out as the Common pin. So to make an
         LED of a
         particular segment glow we just have to power common pin along with the segment pin. This way we can power more
         than one
         segment at a time to represent the numeric number 0-9 and also few Alphabets as shown on the graphic image
         below. We
         also have an option to show a decimal point using the DP pin.

      <h2 id="cmn-cathode">Common Cathode (CC) 7 Segment Display</h2>
      <p>
         The common cathode display is commonly called CC display. In this type the common pin on the 7-segment display
         is
         connected to all the eight Cathode pins of the LEDs. So In order to make this type of seven segment display to
         work we
         should connect he Com pin to the Ground pin and power the other pins with Vcc (+5V typically).
      </p>

      <h2 id="cmn-anode">Common Anode (CA) 7 Segment Display</h2>
      <p>
         The common anode display is commonly called CA display. In this type the common pin on the 7-segment display is
         connected to all the eight Anode pins of the LEDs. So In order to make this type of seven segment display to
         work we
         should connect he Com pin to the Vcc (+5V typically) and ground the required segment pin to turn it on.

      <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a 7-Segment display</h2>
      <p>
         One important advantage of a 7-segment display is that, it is very easy to use. Unlike other display modules a
         7-segment
         display can be made to work even without a Microcontroller or a Microprocessor.
      </p>
      <p>
         This is possible because of the readily available 7-segment counter IC's like IC CD4026. This IC can be used in
         combination with the display for projects which have very simple circuits. The IC can drive one 7-segment
         display module
         and the number that is being displayed can also be incremented or decremented.
      </p>
      <p>
         But, most commonly a seven segment display is used along with a MCU/MPU in that case, the eight segment pins
         will be
         connected to the I/O pins of the Microcontroller and the com pin will be connected to the ground of Vcc
         depending upon
         its type (CC/CA). Then these IO pins can be toggled in a particular sequence to display the desired numbers.
         This
         particular sequence is explained through the table below. For displaying each number in the seven segment
         display its
         respective sequence is given in the table. If we want to display the number “0”, then we need to glow all the
         LEDs
         except LED which belongs to line “g” (see 7 segment pin diagram above, so we need a bit pattern 11000000.
         Similarly to
         display “1”we need to glow LEDs associated with b and c, so the bit pattern for this would be 11111001.
