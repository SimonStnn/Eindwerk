      <h2 id="where-to-use">Where to use HC-05 Bluetooth module</h2>
      <p>
         The HC-05 is a popular module which can add two-way (full-duplex) wireless functionality to your projects. You
         can use
         this module to communicate between two microcontrollers like Arduino or communicate with any device with
         Bluetooth
         functionality like a Phone or Laptop. There are many android applications that are already available which
         makes this
         process a lot easier. The module communicates with the help of USART at 9600 baud rate hence it is easy to
         interface
         with any microcontroller that supports USART. We can also configure the default values of the module by using
         the
         command mode. So if you looking for a Wireless module that could transfer data from your computer or mobile
         phone to
         microcontroller or vice versa then this module might be the right choice for you. However do not expect this
         module to
         transfer multimedia like photos or songs; you might have to look into the CSR8645 module for that.

      <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use the HC-05 Bluetooth module</h2>
      <p>
         The HC-05 has two operating modes, one is the Data mode in which it can send and receive data from other Bluetooth
         devices and the other is the AT Command mode where the default device settings can be changed. We can operate the device
         in either of these two modes by using the key pin as explained in the pin description.
         
         It is very easy to pair the HC-05 module with microcontrollers because it operates using the Serial Port Protocol (SPP).
         Simply power the module with +5V and connect the Rx pin of the module to the Tx of MCU and Tx pin of module to Rx of MCU
         as shown in the figure below
      </p>

      <p>
         During power up the key pin can be grounded to enter into Command mode, if left free it will by default enter into the
         data mode. As soon as the module is powered you should be able to discover the Bluetooth device as “HC-05” then connect
         with it using the default password 1234 and start communicating with it. The name password and other default parameters
         can be changed by entering into the
