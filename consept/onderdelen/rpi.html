         Raspberry pi 3 is a development board in PI series. It can be considered as a single board computer that works
         on LINUX
         operating system. The board not only has tons of features it also has terrific processing speed making it
         suitable for
         advanced applications. PI board is specifically designed for hobbyist and engineers who are interested in LINUX
         systems
         and IoT (Internet of Things).

      <h2 id="where-used">Where is it used?</h2>
      <p>
         Raspberry pi platform is most used after Arduino. Although overall applications of PI are less it is most preferred when
         developing advanced applications. Also the Raspberry pi is an open source platform where one can get a lot of related
         information so you can customize the system depending on the need.
      </p>
      <p>
         Here are few examples where Raspberry pi 3 is chosen over other microcontrollers and development boards:
      </p>
      <p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Where the system processing is huge. Most Arduino boards all have clock speed of less than 100MHz, so they can perform
                  functions limited to their capabilities. They cannot process high end programs for applications like Weather Station,
                  Cloud server, gaming console etc. With 1.2GHz clock speed and 1 GB RAM Raspberry pi can perform all those advanced
                  functions.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Where wireless connectivity is needed. Raspberry pi 3 has wireless LAN and Bluetooth facility by which you can setup
                  WIFI HOTSPOT for internet connectivity. For Internet of Things this feature is best suited.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Raspberry pihad dedicated port for connecting touch LCD display which is a feature that completely omits the need of
                  monitor.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Raspberry pi also has dedicated camera port so one can connect camera without any hassle to the PI board.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  Raspberry pi also has PWM outputs for application use.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
            There are many other features like HD steaming which further promote the use of Raspberry	pi.
         </p>
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-use">How to use</h2>
      <p>
         As mentioned earlier PI is simply a computer on a single board so it cannot be used like Arduino development boards. For
         the PI to start working we need to first install operating system. This feature is similar to our PC. The PI has
         dedicated OS for it; any other OS will not work.
